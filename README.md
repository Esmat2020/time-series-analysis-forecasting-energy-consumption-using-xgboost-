Energy consumption analysis
Analysing how much energy your facility consumes lets you quantify the energy resources associated with your service, and identify and correct consumption inefficiencies.

Measuring energy consumption lets you quantify the energy required by the different systems in your facility. This information is essential to assessing future energy improvement actions in order to optimise your consumption, avoid penalties, reduce the amount of your electric bill or invoice your customers for their energy use.

By installing power analyzers, you can have real-time information on both energy and electrical parameters to account for total and partial consumption, and thus ensure the proper operation of your facility.

Electric energy consumption is energy consumption in the form of electrical energy.[2] About a fifth of global energy is consumed as electricity: for residential, industrial, commercial, transportation and other purposes.[2] Quickly increasing this share by further electrification is extremely important to limit climate change,[3] because most other energy is consumed by burning fossil fuels thus emitting greenhouse gases which trap heat.
